# DecVote
A Decentralized Voting Sytem based on Solana.

This project was encouraged with focus to LNMHacks 6.0, wherein the chain used in the final project were trasferred to AEternitiy Blockchain.

# Advantages-
No third-party involvement, in the processing and vote counting process.
Instantaneous resuslts, as the votes can be processed as soon as they are entered.
Voting results accessible to anyone, but not everyone. (Blockchain)

# Note
This project was intialized but not submitted to the hackathon. Nevertheless, I still am working on creating a working prototype.
